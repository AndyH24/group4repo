In this future based scenerio we are going to be taking a look if a China vs. Taiwan Conflict will meet the criteria to fall under A UN Peacekeeping mission. The People’s Republic of China, established in 1949, has never governed Taiwan but nonetheless views the island as a breakaway territory that must be “unified” with the mainland—by force if necessary. After World War Two the communists took over mainland china and pushed all of the nationalists to taiwan where they proceased to set up a goverment in exile and maintained their claim to the mainland. This has created a lot of tensions over the years to who should be in control of the island. In the receant years the tensions have rised Over the past two decades, tensions between China and Taiwan have escalated due to political shifts and military actions. In 2005, China passed the Anti-Secession Law, threatening force if Taiwan declared independence. This tension grew in 2016 when President Tsai Ing-wen rejected the "1992 Consensus," prompting increased military drills from Beijing. By 2024, China conducted its largest exercises yet, encircling Taiwan with naval and artillery units. Meanwhile, Taiwan has strengthened its defenses and deepened ties with allies like the U.S. The situation remains volatile, with China insisting on reunification while Taiwan asserts its right to self-governance. This conflict may escalate to a world wide scale if somthing decided to pop off.
