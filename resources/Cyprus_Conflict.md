# Background on the Cyprus Conflict (1960s–1970s)

The Cyprus conflict of the 1960s and 1970s was marked by acute ethnic discord between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, leading to bloody clashes, political instability, and the eventual division of the island.

## Historical Background

Cyprus gained independence from British colonial rule in 1960 with a Turkish Cypriot-Greek Cypriot power-sharing republic. The constitution envisioned a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president with a cabinet and legislature in a 7:3 ratio in favor of the Greek Cypriots. The system quickly broke down due to disagreements on how to govern and on constitutional provisions. ([Wikipedia - Cyprus Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_problem))

## Intercommunal Violence (1963–1964)

Things reached a climax in December 1963, which was referred to as "Bloody Christmas," when clashes erupted in Nicosia following a police altercation with Turkish Cypriots. The violence escalated across the island, resulting in high casualties and the displacement of thousands of Turkish Cypriots into enclaves. The bi-communal government collapsed, and the Greek Cypriots assumed control of the administration of the Republic of Cyprus.

## Continued Strife and External Influences

The late 1960s saw further violence, particularly in 1967, when Greek Cypriot military attacked Turkish Cypriot villages, and Turkey threatened to take action. International diplomacy, such as efforts by the United Nations, sought to become involved in the dispute, with little success.

## 1974 Coup and Turkish Invasion

A coup d'état in July 1974, instigated by the Greek military junta to achieve the union of Cyprus with Greece, led to the overthrow of President Makarios. Turkey reacted with a military intervention in its role as a guarantor power to protect Turkish Cypriots. The invasion concluded with the occupation of the northern third of the island, the displacement of around 200,000 Greek Cypriots, and the establishment of a de facto partition.

## Aftermath and Ongoing Division

The island remains split, with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, declared in 1983, being recognized only by Turkey. Despite several rounds of negotiations and UN-facilitated attempts, there has not been a settlement. The division continues to influence regional relations and the lives of Cypriots on both sides of the divide.

This short historical narrative underscores the stubbornness of the Cyprus dispute, rooted in ethnic divisions, geopolitical competition, and challenges of post-colonial state building.
