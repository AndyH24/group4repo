# Background on the Cyprus Conflict (1960s–1970s)

The conflict in Cyprus during the 1960s and 1970s was marked by deep-rooted ethnic tensions between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, leading to violent clashes, political upheaval, and the eventual division of the island.

## Historical Background

Cyprus gained independence from British colonial rule in 1960, establishing a power-sharing republic between the Greek Cypriot majority and the Turkish Cypriot minority. The constitution mandated a Greek Cypriot president and a Turkish Cypriot vice-president, with a cabinet and legislature reflecting a 7:3 ratio favoring Greek Cypriots. However, the arrangement quickly became strained due to disagreements over governance and constitutional provisions. ([Wikipedia - Cyprus Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyprus_problem))

## Intercommunal Violence (1963–1964)

Tensions escalated in December 1963, a period known as "Bloody Christmas," when violence erupted in Nicosia following a police incident involving Turkish Cypriots. The clashes spread across the island, resulting in significant casualties and the displacement of thousands of Turkish Cypriots into enclaves. The power-sharing government collapsed, with Greek Cypriots assuming control of the Republic of Cyprus.

## Continued Strife and External Influences

The late 1960s saw further violence, notably in 1967, when Greek Cypriot forces attacked Turkish Cypriot villages, prompting Turkey to threaten intervention. International diplomacy, including efforts by the United Nations, sought to mediate the conflict, but with limited success.

## 1974 Coup and Turkish Invasion

In July 1974, a coup d'état orchestrated by the Greek military junta aimed to unite Cyprus with Greece, leading to the ousting of President Makarios. In response, Turkey launched a military intervention, citing its role as a guarantor power to protect Turkish Cypriots. The invasion resulted in the occupation of the northern third of the island, the displacement of approximately 200,000 Greek Cypriots, and the establishment of a de facto partition.

## Aftermath and Ongoing Division

The island remains divided, with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus declared in 1983, recognized only by Turkey. Despite numerous rounds of negotiations and UN-led initiatives, a comprehensive settlement has yet to be achieved. The division continues to influence regional relations and the lives of Cypriots on both sides of the divide.

This historical overview underscores the complexity of the Cyprus conflict, rooted in ethnic divisions, geopolitical interests, and the challenges of post-colonial state-building.
