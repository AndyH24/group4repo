# Background on the South Sudan Conflict (2011â€“Present)

## Independence and Early Challenges

South Sudan gained independence from Sudan on July 9, 2011, following a referendum in which nearly 99% of those who participated consented to secession. This was the result of decades of civil war between southern rebels and the Sudanese government. The new nation, however, had early challenges, including underdeveloped infrastructure, economic dependence on oil, and political instability.

## Political Power Struggle and Civil War

Political tensions between President Salva Kiir and former Vice President Riek Machar were escalated into armed conflict in December 2013. Kiir blamed Machar for attempting a coup, and this led to mass ethnic violence between the Dinka and Nuer communities. The conflict led to massive loss of human life and displacement of civilians.

## Humanitarian Crisis

The civil war led to one of the world's most disastrous humanitarian crises. Thousands died and millions were displaced. The war had a major impact on children and youth, causing widespread malnutrition, displacement, and psychological trauma. Peace initiatives by the international community to provide relief and negotiate peace failed to a great extent.

## Peace Efforts and Ongoing Challenges

A number of peace agreements, including the 2015 Agreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in South Sudan and the Revitalized Agreement signed in 2018, have been signed and successively violated. Tensions remain, and peace is tenuous. Recent developments include the deployment of Ugandan special forces to South Sudan to protect the government against threats of civil war.

## Conclusion

The journey towards stability in South Sudan after independence has been fraught with conflict and humanitarian concerns. Despite peace agreements being signed, the path to ultimate stability must still be encouraged by both domestic leadership and the international community.
