# Cyprus

Description: The island of Cyprus experienced escalating violence between the Greek and Turkish communities starting in the 1960s. This reached a tipping point in 1974 when Turkey invaded after a coup by pro-Greek forces. Tensions were rooted in both ethnic divides and competing nationalisms (Enosis for union with Greece vs. Taksim for partition with Turkey). There were also many disputes over political power-sharing agreements post-independence from Britain, leading to issues with external backers.

In the simulation, players will use evaulation metrics and consider the following when making a reccoemndation: 
1. Whether the conflict falls under UN peacekeeping mandates (prevention of conflict spillover, stabilization post-ceasefire).
2. The readiness of both communities and their external backers (Greece, Turkey, Britain) to allow UN intervention.
3. Regional dynamics (NATO involvement, Cold War tensions) and their influence on Security Council decisions.
4. Historical deployment of the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) as a reference, considering whether conditions today would still justify a mission.

Key Consideration for Players: Can a sustainable ceasefire be enforced, and can conditions be created for long-term reconciliation given external power interests?

Prompt: Write a recommendation below on whether this conflict has the ability to have a UN Peace Keeping Mission.
