# South Sudan

Description: 
Following independence from Sudan in 2011, South Sudan quickly descended into a brutal civil war between forces loyal to President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar. This was driven by ethnic divisions (Dinka vs. Nuer), competition for oil resources, and other political power struggles. The humanitarian crisis was catastrophic, and many people were displaced due to famine and war crimes. 

In the simulation, players will evaluate: 
1. Whether the conflict fits peacekeeping mandates (stabilizing conflict situations post-ceasefire, supporting state transition).
2. Whether the South Sudanese government and warring parties would permit a peacekeeping deployment.
3. How the African Union, neighboring countries (Uganda, Ethiopia, Kenya), and external powers (U.S., China) influence peacekeeping prospects.
4. The real-world example of UNMISS (United Nations Mission in South Sudan) and lessons learned for peacekeeper deployment and effectiveness.

Key Challenge for Players: Can a peacekeeping mission stabilize the situation enough to foster peace agreements and democratic governance, despite ongoing violence and discord among factions?
